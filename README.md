# UberText
A development-not-in-production-proof-of-concept for requesting Uber cars via SMS. I have rather crudely cobbled together some rough instructions on how to use what was thrown together as a submission for the Uber Hackathon. I have probably missed some details, but you are more than welcome to get in touch with me and ask anything!

# Usage
- Add your own details to *app.rb*, *form.php* and *index.html* as specified by the comments and follow the further instructions in each file.
- Run *db.rb* to set up the database.
- Keep *app.rb* running.
